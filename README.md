# Disfluency Detector


This repository contains the implementation of the paper by Liu, Jiajun, et al. titled ["Automatic speech disfluency detection using wav2vec2.0 for different languages with variable lengths"](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/13/7579).

Our implementation utilizes the [CORAA dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15731) to automatically detect speech disfluencies, employing wav2vec2.0, in portuguese.
